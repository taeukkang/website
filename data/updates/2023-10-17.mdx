This past summer, I was a Research Intern at Stanford's Human-Computer Interaction Group,
where I developed [Burst](https://projects.taeuk.net/curis-burst/poster.pdf), an experimental
social media that explored novel methods of curation and propagation of content.

I'm also continuing to section lead (TA) for Stanford's [CS106B](https://cs106b.stanford.edu),
Programming Abstractions (in C++).
