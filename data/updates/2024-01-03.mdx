I am continuing research on [Burst](https://projects.taeuk.net/burst-research/poster.pdf),
an experimental social media paradigm, which I've joined in Summer 2023 as a Research Intern for.
Section leading (TA-ing) for Stanford's [CS106B](https://cs106b.stanford.edu),
Programming Abstractions (in C++), is also going on in the background.

Also, I will be joining Stripe this summer (2024) as a Software Engineering Intern.
